# E-mu Audity 2000 Upgrade Repository

## Why this Repo Was Created

Prior to this repository, there was **no official or community-hosted Audity 2000 upgrade project on GitHub**. While firmware upgrades existed historically from E-mu, they were distributed as proprietary OS images, often requiring users to send their units in for service. Hobbyist upgrades and custom ROMs have circulated in forums like Syntaur and Gearspace, but no central, GitHub-accessible source existed.

This repo was created to **archive, preserve, and share the original Audity 2000 OS binaries and the updater tool** for non-commercial use. It provides a single reference point for enthusiasts who want to upgrade their units, follow the documented procedure, and safely access the original OS files without relying on scattered forum posts or unsupported methods.

## Historical Context

### 📌 No official Audity 2000 upgrade project exists on GitHub

There is **no known GitHub repository specifically for an “Audity 2000 upgrade”** tool, firmware, or software project. Searches and available results turned up **nothing on GitHub matching that exact project name or purpose**. Most GitHub repositories related to audio software (e.g., Audacium / Audacity) are **unrelated** to the E-mu Audity 2000 synthesizer upgrade. ([GitHub][1])

### ❓ Audity 2000 Firmware / Upgrade Context

What *does* exist in the real world regarding upgrading an **E-mu Audity 2000**:

* The Audity 2000 was originally upgraded from **OS v1 to v2** using **firmware updates** supplied by E-mu (officially required sending the unit in for service back in the 1990s/2000s). ([e-UniverCity][2])
* Online posts and communities suggest that upgrading older units (v1.00) to v2.01 **required special boot PROMs and a Flash SIMM** for the OS image — a hardware-centric process rather than a simple downloadable tool. ([Syntaur Forums][3])
* Recent hobbyist efforts in forums (e.g., Gearspace) have developed **custom upgrade ROMs** to bring v1.00 units up to v2.01 — but these are *not* hosted on GitHub and are shared via synth forums. ([Gearspace][4])

### 📌 Summary

* **No GitHub repository** exists for an Audity 2000 upgrade project.
* Firmware upgrades historically were distributed by E-mu as proprietary OS images.
* Recent community work on alternate upgrade methods exists but is shared on forums, **not GitHub**. ([Syntaur Forums][3])
